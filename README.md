# Hello Angular: my first project using Angular

My project for my company studies purposes about Angular. I already had experience developing with Angular, but I hadn't time to stop and study.
However, I'll be responsible for develop a project, which was developed with old .net, and will be developed once again using new technologies and good practices, to be easier to maintain, and to have a longer use. This is the purpose of my study. 😄💻
